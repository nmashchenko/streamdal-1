Streamdal is a free and open-source tool that allows you to embed privacy 
controls into application code. These controls can be used to detect PII, or an 
enumerating variety of [data types](/en/guides/pipelines/#detective), as it 
enters and leaves your systems, preventing it from reaching unintended 
databases, data streams, or pipelines.

We call this method of adding privacy controls, and unique 
performance-retaining, near-native speed of handling data with Wasm: 
**Code-Native.**

# <center>Why Code-Native?</center>

It's not just another gimmick for a privacy or data management tool. It's a 
philosophy for a way of thinking and working with data that prioritizes 
a few concepts:

1. Preventing issues vs reacting to issues
2. Flexibility and ease of use
3. Minimalism (i.e. the reduction of complex data infrastructure)
4. Real-time insights... that are _truly_ **real-time** and not _"real-time"_

By having a method that embeds your data privacy controls, data 
transformations, and PII or other data handling operations into code, you will 
ensure compliance happens at runtime in a _preventive way_ vs. traditional 
tooling that relies on a database, log ingestion, or other extra infrastructure 
with network hops in a _reactive way_. 

Read more about this philosophy and design choice in our brief 
[manifesto](https://streamdal.com/manifesto/).

## Walkthrough Video

Explore Streamdal in action! The walkthrough video below shows the platform's 
capabilities and conveys what Code-Native does for handling data. It also shows 
how you can get started with Streamdal along with some examples 
[pipelines](/en/guides/pipelines/).

[general instrumentation](/en/guides/instrumentation) guide, explore the
specific SDKs we _currently_ offer:

- [Go](/en/sdks/go)
- [Node](/en/sdks/node)
- [Python](/en/sdks/python)
- [Ruby](/en/sdks/ruby)

Stay tuned for more SDKs in the pipeline!

We make significant use of open source across many of the Streamdal 
[components](/en/core-components/overview/). Here is a non-exhaustive list of 
some of the stuff we use in our projects:

## [CLI](/en/what-is-streamdal/#cli) 


- [Kong](http://github.com/alecthomas/kong): A nice CLI argument and flag library in Golang which leverages struct tags for declaration
- [Log](http://github.com/charmbracelet/log): A fun and colorful logger 
- [Tview](http://github.com/rivo/tview): An excellent terminal UI library, used by `k9s` and many other well-known projects
- [Tcell](http://github.com/gdamore/tcell/): Used for working with the terminal - used by tview under the hood
- [Godotenv](http://github.com/joho/godotenv): A staple in many of our Go-based projects - loads `.env` files _(if they‚Äôre there)_

## [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/)

- [Deno-Fresh](https://github.com/denoland/fresh) ‚Äî Typescript runtime and full stack web framework
- [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact) ‚Äî Fast JSX for rendering and templating
- [Protobuf-ts](https://github.com/timostamm/protobuf-ts) ‚Äî Typescript gRPC and protocol buffers for Deno
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) ‚Äî Schema declaration and validation
- [React-flow](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow) ‚Äî Interactive node-based UI
- [Flowbite](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite) ‚Äî Tailwind compatible UI widgets
- [Tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) ‚Äî CSS utility framework

## [Server](/en/core-components/server/)

- [Go](https://go.dev/): This is what the server is written in
    
- [gRPC](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc): Nearly all Streamdal [components](/en/core-components/overview/) use gRPC for communication. We use both `unary` and `streaming` functionality for communicating with [SDKs](/en/core-components/sdk/), communicating with other cluster nodes, and talking with the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/)
- [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/): Our protos are open source and you can find them on [GitHub](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/libs/protos). As with gRPC, Protobuf is a crucial part of the Streamdal ecosystem

    It's used for:
    - Defining internal and external APIs
    - Establishing a stable API spec used by SDKs
    - Facilitating <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#wasm" class="pkeyword">Wasm</a> functionality
    - _And a many other uses_
- [UUID](https://github.com/google/uuid): This library generates and inspects UUIDs based on RFC 4122 and DCE 1.1: Authentication and Security Services.
- [Redis](https://redis.io): Used for internal communications between cluster nodes and as the primary storage mechanism. _We specifically use redis for Pubsub and its traditional key/value functionality._
    - [Go-Redis](https://github.com/redis/go-redis): The Redis lib we use

    Streamdal Trivia: 
    
    We used [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) and 
    [NATS](https://github.com/nats-io) in the beginning, but they both proved 
    to be too much for what we needed. Also, most folks recognize `redis` and 
    won‚Äôt raise eyebrows when they see it.

- [Kong](https://github.com/alecthomas/kong): A really awesome CLI `arg` and `flag` library that uses `struct` tags for declaration 
_(More trivia: [alecthomas](https://github.com/alecthomas) also wrote the excellent [kingpin](https://github.com/alecthomas/kingpin) library)_
- [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) & [Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega): Our choice of BDD test framework + matcher. The server is complex, highly concurrent, and has _many_ moving parts. These libs have helped us write more thorough tests that are still easy to grok  _(even if you haven‚Äôt looked at them in a while)_
- [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus):  A popular, structured logging library
- [Httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter): A fast, lightweight muxer we use for our REST API. While most internal communication in Streamdal happens with gRPC, the pieces that are not are powered by this library
- [Ratecounter](https://github.com/paulbellamy/ratecounter): We use this library to calculate rates (such as throughput over time)
- [Go-director](https://github.com/relistan/go-director): This library enables us to declare for loops as injectable dependencies, which greatly simplifies testing

## [SDKs](/en/core-components/sdk/)

Currently we support [Go](/en/sdks/go/), [Node](/en/sdks/node/) and 
[Python](/en/sdks/python/). We have plans to add more 
SDKs in the future. Check the 
[roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/streamdal/projects/1) for more information.

## <span class="pkeyword">Wasm</span>
The 
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rule</a> 
functionality of Streamdal uses 
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#wasm" class="pkeyword">Wasm</a> 
extensively under the hood. Most of our Wasm modules are 
[open source](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/libs/wasm).

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ‚Äî The language most of the modules are written in
- [Serde](https://serde.rs/) ‚Äî For working with JSON
- [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) - Used for facilitating communication between the executor ([SDKs](/en/core-components/sdk/)) and the Wasm modules themselves. In other words, we encode requests in Protobuf, pass them to Wasm, and the modules return Protobuf-encoded responses

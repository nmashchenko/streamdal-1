### <span class="hiddenh">1. What is Streamdal?</span>
<li>
<Accordion
title="What is Streamdal?">
<p>
Streamdal is an open source <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#observability" class="pkeyword">observability</a> tool.
<br />
It's comprised of a
[server](/en/core-components/server/), a UI, and a bunch of <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#wasm" class="pkeyword">Wasm</a>-powered
[SDKs](/en/core-components/sdk/). By using our SDK and deploying it’s server,
you’ll get a dynamic [graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph) of your
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producers</a>
and <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumers</a>
as they scale up and down, with the ability to tap in and view all the
real-time data flowing through them with [Tail](/en/guides/tail/).
</p>
<br />
<p>
You can use Tail from the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/). Or,
for those who prefer a terminal, you can use the
[CLI](/en/what-is-streamdal/#-cli).
</p>
<br />
<p>
The stuff you can use to modify your "in-flight" data such as stripping PII,
masking, obfuscating, or validating data is of a certain format or structure,
etc is done with <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a>.
Currently, rules and the
preventive/[data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) features are in
beta.
</p>
</Accordion>

### <span class="hiddenh">2. How do I use Streamdal, and where is it deployed?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="How do I use Streamdal, and where is it deployed?">
<p>
1. Import our SDK for your language.
2. Weave the `Process()` method into the fabric of your code where
data production or consumption takes place.
3. Deploy the Streamdal server where the services using the Streamdal SDK are
running.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Check out the [quickstart guide](/en/getting-started/quickstart/).

You can find more details in our guides on
[instrumentation](/en/guides/instrumentation/) and
[deployment](/en/guides/deployment/).
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hiddenh">3. What language SDKs do you support?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="What language SDKs do you support?">
<p>
Currently we support:
<br />
<ul>
<li>[Go](/en/sdks/go/)</li>
<li>[Node](/en/sdks/node/)</li>
<li>[Python](/en/sdks/python/)</li>
<li>[Ruby](/en/sdks/ruby/)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br />
<p>
We plan on adding more language support in the future, along with
libraries/[shims](/en/resources-support/glossary/#shim) for easier
instrumentation. Check out the
[roadmap](/en/resources-support/roadmap/) for more details.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hiddenh">4. What data sources and destinations are supported?</span>
<li>
<Accordion
title="What data sources and destinations are supported?">
<p>
Any <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#source" class="pkeyword">source</a>, and any <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#destination" class="pkeyword">destination</a>.
<br />
The way Streamdal is instrumented, there isn't
a need for connectors or interfacing with various API's. The [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) uses a
`Process()` method that is wrapped around the parts of your code where data
production and consumption take place.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hiddenh">5. Will this cause HTTP bottlenecks, or impact my app performance in any way?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="Will this cause HTTP bottlenecks, or impact my app performance in any
way?">
<p>
The work all happens <span class="yhighlight">locally</span> in the SDK,
and on the client. The server component is just there to configure things on
the client by shipping down <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> created in the Console UI.

<br />

This happens with only a negligible resource hit to the client (usally \<0.1ms,
thanks to
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#wasm" class="pkeyword">Wasm</a>).
There is no sending data, or shipping logs, metrics, or traces anywhere.

<br />

[benchmark tests](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/blob/main/libs/wasm-detective/src/test_bench.rs)
on GitHub.

### <span class="hiddenh">6. Why aren't my services, producers, or consumers showing up on the data graph?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="Why aren't my services, producers, or consumers showing up on the data
graph?">
<p>
There are many reasons why your service isn't showing up on the data graph -
from misconfiguration, to network issues, to improper SDK usage. <br /><br />

Here are some troubleshooting tips: <br />

</p>
<br />
<p>
1. The [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) should be imported and properly
instrumented for your language. See the
[Golang example](/en/core-components/sdk/#golang-sdk-example) on importing the
SDK.
2. The [server](/en/core-components/server/) needs to be accessible by the SDK.
If you have confirmed the containers are up, try running
`curl <streamdal-server>:<endpoints>`. Check out the various
[endpoints exposed](/en/core-components/server#server-high-level-architecture)
by the server components for further testing.
   - The `STREAMDAL_URL` default
  [environment variable](/en/core-components/sdk/#environment-variables-configuring-the-sdk)
  value is
  `localhost:9090`. If you are running the server somewhere other than where
  your instrumented services live, you will need to update this value to the correct address.
3. Make sure to see if the initial instantiation is producing an error. For example,
in the Golang SDK, the `streamdal.New(...)` method returns the client and error -
check if error is non-nil.
4. The `Process()` method **MUST** fire at least once in order for the service to
show up on the data graph. This is _extremely_ common: a service might be calling
`Register()` but never reaches a `Process()` call.
5. Make sure that the instantiated Streamdal client stays available for the entire
runtime of your service. The Streamdal client launches several background workers
that are responsible for receiving commands from the server, sending heartbeats,
metrics and many other things. If the Streamdal client is closed, the even if the
`Process()` call completes, the service will not show as "attached" on the data
graph.
    * Common practice is to instantiate the Streamdal client at startup and make
    it available to other parts of the your application for continuous re-use.
    * In most cases, the ony time the Streamdal client should get closed/destroyed
    is when your service is shutting down.
6. Try to clear the Redis store that Streamdal server uses via `redis-cli`: clear
all `streamdal_*` keys or perform a `FLUSHALL` command; followed by a re-start of
Streamdal server. The server will repopulate the Redis store with the correct data.
7. Make sure your service stays running and does not prematurely exit. If the
streamdal client is closed (due to your service exiting) - the service will never
show as "attached" on the data graph.

### <span class="hiddenh">7. I see Rules in the Console UI, but they are listed as `Beta.` Can I use this feature?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="I see Rules in the Console UI, but they are listed as `Beta.` Can I use
this feature?">
<p>
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">Rules</a>
are currently in beta along with the other
[data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) features of Streamdal.

<br />

They are being tested by a select group of contributors, companies, and design
partners.

<br />

_These features aren't production-ready!_ But, if you would like
to get test access or become a design partner,

### <span class="hiddenh">8. What is open source, what is free, and what is paid? Will this change in the future?</span>


<li>
<Accordion
title="What is open source, what is free, and what is paid? Will this change in
the future?">
<p>
The <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#observability" class="pkeyword">observability</a>
aspects and features of Streamdal, including [Tail](/en/guides/tail/), will
always be free and [open source](/en/resources-support/open-source/) using the
Apache License v2.0.

<br />

Currently, the data governance features are in beta, but once they are fully
fleshed out and production-ready, they _may_ be a paid feature. We haven't
decided which parts of the governance features might need to be paid.

<br />

Regardless of how that decision pans out, we will not be rug-pulling anything
we put out as open source.

<br />

Check out our
[launch manifesto](https://streamdal.com/manifesto/) for details on this design
decision.

### <span class="hiddenh">9. When will you support `<this-feature-language-or-library>`?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="When will you support <this-feature-language-or-library>?">

Our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/streamdal/projects/1) is publicly
available on GitHub.

### <span class="hiddenh">10. How do I maintain the Data Graph?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="How do I maintain the Data Graph?">
<p>
The [Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph) is _real-time_ and _dynamic_.

<br />
What that means is so long as the
[server component](/en/core-components/server/)
is running, and new <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#service" class="pkeyword">services</a> are instrumented with the
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/), _the Data Graph will not require maintenance_.

<br />

The view you
get will always be an accurate representation of data flowing through your
systems regardless of scale.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hiddenh">11. How do I manage schemas?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="How do I manage schemas?">
<p>
Currently, there is no need to manage schemas. Once you have instrumented the
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/), you will be able to view the active schemas of
data throughout your systems.

<br />

When you weave the `Process()` method throughout your code, behind the scenes
the SDK will infer and decode schemas, and present them in a human-readable
format via the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

<br />

We have big plans to expand schemas in the future. This could include tools,
management capabilities, or functionality such as history and diff views.

<br />

Reference the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/streamdal/projects/1)
for more information.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hiddenh">12. What is Tail?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="What is Tail?">
<p>
Tail gets its name from the Unix command and argument `tail -f`.

<br />

It is a feature that can be used via the
[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) (or
[CLI](/en/what-is-streamdal/#cli)) which will allow you to tap into any of
your <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producers</a>
or <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumers</a>
and view the real-time data flowing through them.

<br />

Because schemas are inferred and decoded, you'll be able to observe your data
in a human-readable format.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hiddenh">13. What are Shims?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="What are Shims?">
<p>
A <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#shim" class="pkeyword">Shim</a> is a
'wrapper library' for popular libraries that incorporate the usage of our SDK
to simplify the integration and adoption of Streamdal.

<br />

Our primary focus has been on the SDKs, and shims will land sometime in the
future. Check the
[roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/streamdal/projects/1) to see when they
could be added.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hiddenh">14. What is Observability?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="What is Observability?">
<p>
<span class="pkeyword">Observability</span> can be a really loaded term, which
is why we also define it in our [glossary](/en/resources-support/glossary#observability) and
have [a whole section dedicated](/en/engineering/observability/) to it.
Depending on what you're working with or who you're speaking to, it can mean
many different things.
</p>
<br />
<p>
When we say observability, we mean:
> _The ability to simply see the actual real-time data, its schema, and the
services generating data or interacting with it._
</p>
<br />
<p>
DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) also has a good definition on
[observability](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/monitoring-and-observability/#:~:text=Observability%20is%20tooling%20or%20a%20technical%20solution%20that%20allows%20teams%20to%20actively%20debug%20their%20system.%20Observability%20is%20based%20on%20exploring%20properties%20and%20patterns%20not%20defined%20in%20advance.)
within this context, which defines it as:

> _...tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to actively debug their
system. Observability is based on exploring properties and patterns not defined
in advance._
</p>
<br />
<p>
We see [Tail](/en/guides/tail/) as a crucial part of this, and the primary
function enabling data observability with Streamdal. Here are the following
features we consider as "observability" features:
</p>
<br />
<p>
- [Tail](/en/guides/tail/)
- [Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph)
- [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/)
- [Schemas](/en/core-components/overview/#console-ui-the-observability-command-center)

</li>

### <span class="hiddenh">16. What role does Wasm play in Streamdal?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="What role does Wasm play in Streamdal?">
<p>
We make significant use of <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#wasm" class="pkeyword">Wasm</a>.

<br />

Rules are supported by Wasm 100%. Schema inference, rules, and any sort of
business logic is going to be executed by Wasm in the SDK.

<br />

The reason we're able to have such a low impact on any given client's resources,
usually less than 0.1ms, is because it's being executed via Wasm. It's
[open source](/en/resources-support/open-source/#wasm).

<br />

Get more information on how we use it in the
[Wasm section](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/libs) of the

### <span class="hiddenh">18. Does Streamdal support Protobuf or other binary encoding formats?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="Does Streamdal support Protobuf or other binary encoding formats?">
<p>
We are unabashed fans of and **experts with Protobuf**. It's used in the primary
API - we use it everywhere. We have even released previous open source tools
like [plumber](https://github.com/streamdal/plumber) which has extensive
protobuf support.

<br />

Right now **Streamdal will only work with JSON or non-binary data**, but we have
plans to add support in the near future.

<li>
<Accordion
title="What are the numbers on the lines between my services and backends?">
<p>
Those numbers are throughput details for the edges in those particular groups of
components.

<br />

In the screenshot below, the arrows are pointing to the
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producer</a>

### <span class="hiddenh">20. What is live/real-time in the app?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="What is live/real-time in the app?">
<p>
Nearly everything.

<br />

The app is always connected to the backend and the [server](/en/core-components/server/). It will receive and
react to every update that happens on the server:
<br />
- Throughput information
- the [Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph) (i.e. when a new SDK is instrumented and the `Process()` is called, it will start showing up on the data graph)
- [Tail](/en/guides/tail/)
- Schemas
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>


### <span class="hiddenh">21. I see direction indicators on the lines. What are those for?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="I see direction indicators on the lines. What are those for?">
<p>
These are very important. They show the direction of the flow of data.

<br />

- Going up means it's a read, and is a <img src={consumer_icon} class="inlineimg" /> <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumer</a>
- Going down means it's a write, and is a <img src={producer_icon} class="inlineimg" /> <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producer</a>
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>


### <span class="hiddenh">22. I saw that I must pass a ServiceName, ComponentName, OperationType, and OperationName in the SDK - what are those?</span>

<li>
<Accordion
title="I saw that I must pass a ServiceName, ComponentName, OperationType, and OperationName in the SDK - what are those?">
<p>
We refer to these as the
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#audience" class="pkeyword">audience</a>,
which identifies a specific service + operation type
(<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#consumer" class="pkeyword">consume</a> or <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#producer" class="pkeyword">producer</a>),
and name for the operation type and component.

<br />
You will always see these. There is an envar for some of them, but these are
declared via [SDK instrumentation](/en/core-components/sdk/) is
[instrumented](/en/guides/instrumentation/).

<br /><br />
_Or in other words, when you call `streamdal.Process(...)`, you will pass the
audience you'd like to identify that operation as._

</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hiddenh">23. The data graph shows '0 attached' for a node. What does it mean?</span>

<li>
    <Accordion
        title="The data graph shows '0 attached' for a node. What does it mean?">
        <p>
            `"Attached"` indicates whether an SDK is _actively_ connected to the server.
            If it is "attached", you will be able to perform "Tail" on that particular
            node to observe the data that is flowing through it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            In addition, a node with `1` or more attached clients will also display
            the current throughput details in the data graph - this can be really
            useful for monitoring and debugging your service in real-time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            **If it is showing "0 attached"**, it means the SDK is not actively connected
            to the server. If this is incorrect, refer to the [troubleshooting steps
            lined out in the FAQ](/en/resources-support/faq/#6-why-arent-my-services-producers-or-consumers-showing-up-on-the-data-graph).

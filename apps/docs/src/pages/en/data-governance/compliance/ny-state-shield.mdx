  <p style="font-weight: lighter;">The data compliance features of Streamdal 
  are currently in beta, and being tested with a select group of contributors, 
  companies, and design partners. If you would like to participate in the beta,

The New York <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/S5575" target="_blank">"Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security Act"</a> 
_(SHIELD Act)_ aims to enhance the protection of New Yorkers' private information 
by requiring businesses to implement reasonable security safeguards and 
broadening the notification requirements to consumers in the event of a data 
breach.

Streamdal will strengthen technical safeguards for data in motion, along with 
helping assess and mitigate risks with data processing and transmission.

## Streamdal's Approach

You can leverage Streamdal for:

**Enforcing data handling policies:** You can establish <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> and [pipelines](/en/guides/pipelines/) that data must adhere to from the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/). For example, you could obfuscate `social security numbers`, `names`, `addresses`, or other PII data before it enters sensitive data stores, and block or limit PII from entering critical environments.
{/* */}
**Assessing and mitigating risks for real-time data:** Within the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/), the [Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph) provides a view of the flow of data throughout your systems. From there, you can tap into real-time data with [Tail](/en/guides/tail/) to better understand data flow or anomalies, and ensure data handling policies are compliant.

> **Coming Soon**: A visual guide on setting up N.Y. SHIELD-specific rules in the 
[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

## Regulatory Insights

We wanted to make researching the relevant data regulations easier and give a 
better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, the combination of the observability and data 
governance capabilities will ensure successful compliance. 

While more sections could be applicable, below is one taken from the 
_NY State SHIELD Act[^1]_ along with how Streamdal can help with data 
compliance:

| ยง Sections | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| 899-bb. Data security protections (2) Reasonable security requirement | The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) will enforce [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) and [pipelines](/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset) you define in the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) for all your real-time data, and ensure your data handling policies are enforced <u>every time data moves.</u> <br /><br /> The [Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph) will provide a visual flow of data through your systems, and [Tail](/en/guides/tail/) allows you to tap into real-time data to explore data and any anomalous activities. |

    _Did you know:_
    
    _The NY SHIELD Act defines "compliant regulated entities," 
    along with small businesses, as <u>any person or business that is subject 
    to</u> the [GLBA](/en/data-governance/compliance/glba/), [HIPAA](/en/data-governance/compliance/hipaa/), <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/hitech-act-enforcement-interim-final-rule/index.html" target="_blank">HITECH</a>, or "any other data security rules and 
    regulations of, and the statutes administered by any official department, 
    division, commission, or agency of the federal or New York state 
    government[^1]."_

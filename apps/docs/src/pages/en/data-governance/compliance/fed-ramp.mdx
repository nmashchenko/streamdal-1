  <p style="font-weight: lighter;">The data compliance features of Streamdal 
  are currently in beta, and being tested with a select group of contributors, 
  companies, and design partners. If you would like to participate in the beta,

<a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program</a> 
_(FedRAMP)_ mandates cloud services to meet consistent security and quality 
standards. Achieving and maintaining this certification can be complex, but 
Streamdal can help simplify the process.

## Streamdal's Approach

Leverage Streamdal for:

**Data Protection**: You can implement rules on data to consistently govern 
how federal information is processed. The SDK can help prevent accidental 
transmission or unauthorized access by disallowing data from leaving its 
defined boundaries. 

By creating <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#step-or-rule" class="pkeyword">rules</a> and attaching [pipelines](/en/guides/pipelines/) to <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producers</a> and <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumers</a>, you can 
ensure development environments are not processing, storing, or transmitting federal information.

**Incident Response**: Streamline your response to security incidents by 
setting up automated workflows that aid your team in rapidly addressing threats.

**Continuous Monitoring**: Implement rules to consistently monitor cloud 
environments, detecting and alerting on any unauthorized access or anomalous 
activities that might signify a potential security threat.

> **Coming Soon**: A visual guide on setting up FedRAMP-specific rules in the 
[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

## Regulatory Insights

We wanted to make researching the relevant data regulations easier and give a 
better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, the combination of the observability and data 
governance capabilities will ensure successful compliance. 

While more key concepts should be applicable, below are two taken from the 
_FedRAMP CSO's Impact Levels[^1]_ along with how Streamdal can help with data 
compliance:

| Key Concepts | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| #1 (All Impact levels): Defining Your Authorization Boundary in the Cloud | Streamdal can play a key part in defining and protecting data boundaries for the authorizing officials operating in your systems. You can write [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) for controlling access to data, and [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) to protect the flow of all federal information and metadata from leaving its boundaries. |
| #4 (FR-High): Interconnections in the Cloud | Streamdal will significantly uncomplicate the disclosing process to the AO (Agency of Authorizing Authority). Without necessarily defining [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step), simply using the [observability](/en/resources-support/glossary/#observability) Streamdal offers will surface all of the data handling portions of your systems. |

    _Did you know:_ 
    
    _An <u>API that calls data from an external source</u>, 
    <u>IaaS that a PaaS or SaaS resides upon</u>, or external systems that 
    provide <u>audit logging</u>, <u>vulnerability scanning</u>, or 
    <u>ticketing systems</u> are all examples of external services that could 
    impact the CIA (confidentiality, integrity, or availability) of federal 
    information._

A system’s category is dependent on the potential impact on an agency’s assets and operations should their information and information systems be compromised through unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. These are the standards Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) must employ to ensure their services meet the minimum security requirements for the data processed, stored, and transmitted._

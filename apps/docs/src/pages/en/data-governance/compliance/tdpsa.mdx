  <p style="font-weight: lighter;">The data compliance features of Streamdal 
  are currently in beta, and being tested with a select group of contributors, 
  companies, and design partners. If you would like to participate in the beta,

The <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB4" target="_blank">Texas Data Privacy and Security Act</a> 
_(TDPSA)_ is a Texas law that will go into effect on July 1, 2024. It regulates 
the collection, processing, and use of sensitive data.

Streamdal can help keep your data in compliance with this regulation.

## Streamdal's Approach

You can leverage Streamdal for:

**Data Minimization:** The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can enforce <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> on <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">consumers</a> and <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">producers</a> to reject or alert on data if it contains more personal data than what is necessary, ensuring data minimization.

**De-identifying and Masking Data:** From the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/), you can establish rules and attach them to your producers and consumers as [pipelines](/en/guides/pipelines/) that data must adhere to in order to proceed through your systems. You can have the SDK filter and alert for PII, and obfuscate sensitive fields to ensure only pseudonymous data is used in appropriate systems.


> **Coming Soon**: A visual guide on setting up TDPSA-specific rules in the 
[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

## Regulatory Insights

We wanted to make researching the relevant data regulations easier and give a 
better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, the combination of the observability and data 
governance capabilities will ensure successful compliance. 

While more sections could be applicable, below are two taken from the 
_TDPSA[^1]_ along with how Streamdal can help with data compliance:

| ยง Sections | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| Sec. 541.101 Controller Duties; Transparency. | The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) allows you to create [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) ensuring only necessary data is collected and moves through your systems. <br /><br /> For example, you could ensure fields like `social security number`, `IP address`, or `credit card number` are never transferred into storage or critical environments, or are obfuscated/masked. |
| Sec. 541.106 Deidentified or Pseudonymous Data.| Similar to ensuring data minimization, you can establish [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) to ensure data is deidentified or made pseudonymous before it reaches your analytical systems. <br /><br /> Fields like `name`, `address`, `e-mail`, and much more can all be masked or turned into pseudonymous data in real time. |

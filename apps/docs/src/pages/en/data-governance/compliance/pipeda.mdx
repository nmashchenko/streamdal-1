  <p style="font-weight: lighter;">The data compliance features of Streamdal 
  are currently in beta, and being tested with a select group of contributors, 
  companies, and design partners. If you would like to participate in the beta,

Canada's <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/" target="_blank">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a> 
_(PIPEDA)_ regulates how private businesses handle personal information during 
commercial activities. It aims to strike a balance between individual privacy 
rights and the operational needs of businesses to utilize such data.

Streamdal is a powerful tool to help keep your data compliant with PIPEDA 
principals.

## Streamdal's Approach

You can leverage Streamdal for:

**Limiting Data Collection:** The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can enforce <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> on <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumers</a> and <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producers</a> to reject data or alert you if it contains more personal data than what is necessary, ensuring data minimization.

**Data Accuracy:** Along with the rules you can set up to limit the collection of data, the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can validate and filter for specific fields of data.

**For example**: you could set up rules to validate fields such as `time`, `name`,  `social security number`, and much more to ensure information is present and accurate. 

**Enforcing Data Policies and Safeguards:** Because the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) executes your rules and [pipelines](/en/guides/pipelines/) as data is being `produced` or `consumed`, you will be able to mask, obfuscate, and otherwise enforce PII handling policies before it moves through your system - and every step afterward as needed.

[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

## Regulatory Insights

We wanted to make researching the relevant data regulations easier and give a 
better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, the combination of the observability and data 
governance capabilities will ensure successful compliance. 

While more principles could be applicable, below are a few taken from 
The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada's _"PIPEDA in brief"[^1]_ 
along with how Streamdal can help with data compliance:

| Principals | How Streamdal Helps Comply |
|-|-|
| (4) Limiting collection | The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can enforce [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) on [consumers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer) and [producers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer) to reject or alert on data if it contains more personal data than what is necessary, ensuring data minimization.|
| (6) Accuracy | [Rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) and [Pipelines](/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset) can be attached to [producers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer) and [consumers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer) to ensure data is valid and accurate and alert for anomalies. <br /><br />For example, you could create [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) to filter for `e-mail address`, `phone number`, `IP address`, and other sensitive fiends like those listed above in our [approach](/en/data-governance/compliance/pipeda#streamdals-approach), and much more to ensure data is valid. |
| (7) Safeguards | You can physically apply your data safeguards to [producers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer) and [consumers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer) handling sensitive data by creating [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) and attaching them as [pipelines](/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset). <br /><br />From the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) (or [Streamdal CLI](/en/guides/tail/#cli)), you can periodically audit real-time data with [Tail](/en/guides/tail/) to ensure data is flowing within the necessary safeguards. |

    _The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada suggests the following 
    checklist for ensuring data accuracy:_
    
    - _List the specific items of personal information you need to provide a service._
    - _List where all related personal information can be found._
    - _Record the date when the personal information was obtained or updated._
    - _Record the steps taken to verify the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the information. This may require reviewing your records or communicating with your customer[^2]._

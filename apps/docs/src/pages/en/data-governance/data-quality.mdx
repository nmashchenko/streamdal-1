  <p style="font-weight: lighter;">The data quality features of Streamdal 
  are currently in beta, and being tested with a select group of contributors, 
  companies, and design partners. If you would like to participate in the beta, 
  please 
  [reach out to us](/en/resources-support/get-support/).</p>
</Notification>

As briefly mentioned in the [Data Governance](/en/data-governance/overview) 
overview, Streamdal can also be used to ensure data quality projects, teams or 
across any organization _with breathtaking swiftness_. 

> **Coming Soon**: A visual guide on setting up Data Quality-specific rules in 
the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

Once we are out of beta, this section will detail how 
you can use [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#step--rule), 
[pipelines](/en/guides/pipelines/), and 
[functions](/en/resources-support/glossary/#wasm) to ensure data quality, 
design data contracts, and streamline data validation.

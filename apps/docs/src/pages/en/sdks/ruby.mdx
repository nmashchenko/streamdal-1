## Instrumentation

Start with the [instrumentation guide](/en/guides/instrumentation/) if you
haven't already. It will walk you through the process of setting up Streamdal
and its components.

## Getting Started

1. Install the gem

```bash
gem install streamdal
```

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.0.0 or higher

### Example

Here's a basic example of how to use the Ruby SDK:

```ruby
require 'streamdal'

# Create a new client
logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
logger.level = Logger::INFO

client = Streamdal::Client.new({
                                 streamdal_url: "localhost:8082",
                                 streamdal_token:"1234",
                                 service_name: "demo",
                                 log: logger,
                                 dry_run: false
                               })

# Define the audience
audience = Streamdal::Audience.new(Streamdal::OPERATION_TYPE_CONSUMER, "consume", "kafka-consumer")

while true
  sleep(2)
  resp = client.process('{"email": "someuser@streamdal.com"}', audience)
  puts "Response: "
  puts "-----------------------------------"
  puts resp.inspect.gsub(/\\n/, "\n")
  puts "-----------------------------------"
end
```
This example demonstrates how to initialize a new instance of the Streamdal
SDK, and how to process data through a method call.

A more full featured demo is located within the [Ruby SDK](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/ruby/demo)

## Libraries
Along with additional language support, we plan forking specific libraries that 
would be impactful to have the Streamdal functionality. Read more about our 
[Libraries/Shims](/en/core-components/libraries-shims).

Below are some additions we are considering based on feedback from our design 
partners and current users:


|  <u>Messaging Systems</u> |  <u>Database</u> |
|---|---|
|rdkafka-ruby|ruby-pg|
|bunny|mong-ruby-driver|
|rest-client|sqlite3-ruby|
|graphql-ruby|activerecord|
|http.rb|redis-rb|
|nats.rb|grape|

The discussions and feedback our users and the open source community brings 
will be incredibly value to feature development.

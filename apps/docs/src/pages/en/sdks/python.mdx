Welcome to the Python Client Guide for Streamdal! If you're leveraging the 
power of Python and aim to enhance your data operations, you're on the right
track. Integrating Streamdal into your Python applications is both efficient and
straightforward with our Python SDK.

## Instrumentation

Start with the [instrumentation guide](/en/guides/instrumentation/) if you 
haven't already. It will walk you through the process of setting up Streamdal 
and its components. 

## Getting Started

1. Install the SDK package:

```bash
python -m pip install streamdal
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system.

### Example

Here's a basic example to help you get started with Streamdal Python SDK:

```python
import pprint
from streamdal import (OPERATION_TYPE_CONSUMER, ProcessRequest, StreamdalClient, StreamdalConfig)

client = StreamdalClient(
    cfg=StreamdalConfig(
        service_name="order-ingest",
        streamdal_url="streamdal-server.svc.cluster.local:8082",
        streamdal_token="1234",
    )
)

res = client.process(
    ProcessRequest(
        operation_type=OPERATION_TYPE_CONSUMER,
        operation_name="new-order-topic",
        component_name="kafka",
        data=b'{"object": {"field": true}}',
    )
)

pprint.pprint(res)
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize a new instance of the Streamdal 
SDK, and how to process data through a method call. 

You simply need to create a configuration object and a process request object, 
and then call the process method on a new Streamdal instance. The result will 
be printed to the console.

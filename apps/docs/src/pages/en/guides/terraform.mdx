Alternatively to configuring pipelines via the UI, and to enhance pipeline 
portability, we offer a [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/streamdal/streamdal/latest). 
This allows you to define pipelines, steps, audiences and assignments 
programmatically.

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code 
software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision 
resources and infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as 
HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.

## Streamdal Terraform Provider

- [Github Source Code](https://github.com/streamdal/terraform-provider-streamdal)
- [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/streamdal/streamdal/latest)

### Example Provider Setup

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    streamdal = {
      source = "streamdal/streamdal"
      version = "0.1.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "streamdal" {
  # Change this to your token or add secret-management envars
  token              = "1234"
  address            = "localhost:8082"
  connection_timeout = 10
}
```

You can reference pipeline examples in the [example](https://github.com/streamdal/terraform-provider-streamdal/tree/main/examples) 
folder of the provider source code. While we recommend using a versioned 
provider, you may optionally leave `version` out to always pull the `latest`.

## Troubleshooting

### Doubled Audiences

When using Terraform to provision pipelines, your `streamdal_audience` 
resources must match what is configured in your application code. If these do 
not match, then you might see multiple distinct audiences or audiences without 
pipelines.

To ensure proper provisioning of pipelines, you should ensure the following 
terraform provisioning and code implementation match:

- Service Name
- Operation Name
- Component Name

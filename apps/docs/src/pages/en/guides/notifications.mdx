Pipeline notifications are a great way to keep your team informed about the 
status of your pipelines. You can set up notifications to be sent to Slack, 
email, or PagerDuty.

Notifications can be configured to trigger on pipeline success, failure, or 
error.

## Notification Types

The Streamdal server currently supports the following notification types:

* [Slack](#slack)
* [Email](#e-mail-smtp-or-ses)
* [PagerDuty](#pagerduty)

## Slack
To set up Slack notifications, you will need to create a Slack app and add it 
to your workspace. Once you have the app installed, you can configure the 
notifications in the Streamdal console.

Steps:

Head over to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and 
create a new app from scratch.

<img src={createSlackApp} alt="Create Slack App" />

Let's name it **Streamdal Notifications**

<img src={createSlackAppName} alt="Create Slack App Name" />

Select **OAuth & Permissions** from the left-hand menu and add the following 
scopes:



Under **Scopes** > **Bot Token Scopes**, add the following scopes:
    * `chat:write`
    * `chat:write.public`

<img src={selectCopes} alt="Select Scopes" />

Click **Install to workspace** and install the app in your desired workspace

<img src={installSlackApp} alt="Install Slack App" />

Once installed, you can then copy the generated **Bot User OAuth Token**.

<img src={copyBotToken} alt="Copy Bot Token" />

Navigate to your installation of the Streamdal console and select 
**Notifications** from the left-hand menu.

<img src={streamdalConsole} alt="Streamdal Console" />

Click **Add Notification**. Enter a name. We'll name our configuration 
**Engineering Slack Channel** for clarity. Select **Slack** as the type, and 
enter the **Bot Token** you copied earlier. You must also choose a slack 
channel for the notifications to be sent to.

<img src={configNotification} alt="Config Notification" />

Now you have successfully set up a Slack notification config, you can enable it 
on a pipeline step. Let's go edit one of our pipeline's steps and enable the 
notification:

<img src={stepNotification} alt="Step Notification" />

You can enable this notification on either the success, failure, or error 
events, or all three. We'll just enable it on the success event for now. Simply 
expand the **On True** section and check the notification you just created.

You can select whether to include the payload that triggered the notification. 
There are three options available:
* **EXCLUDE** - The payload will not be included in the notification
* **FULL PAYLOAD** - The entire payload will be included in the notification
* **SELECT PATHS** - You can select specific paths from the payload to include 
in the notification. The paths should be in a dot notation format, e.g. 
`data.user.name` to select the name field from the payload:

```json
{
   "data": {
      "user": {
         "name": "John Doe",
         "age": 30
      }
   }
}
```

Save the pipeline and your notifications are now set up!

Let's see what a Slack notification looks like:

## E-mail: SMTP or SES

Email notifications can be sent via SMTP or Amazon SES.
At least one recipient is required. If you wish to add additional recipients, 
click the *Add a new Recipient +* button.

### SMTP

Select `SMTP` from the **Email Notification Type** dropdown. All fields are 
required.

required.

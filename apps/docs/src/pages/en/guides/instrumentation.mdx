The [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) should initiliazed in your application 
where data consumption or production takes place. The SDK is responsible for 
sending data to the Streamdal [server](/en/core-components/server/), which then 
processes it and returns a response.

## SDK flow
1. **Initializing Streamdal Client:** The SDK's streamdal.New() method is invoked with a configuration object, initializing a new Streamdal client.
2. **Processing a Request:** The sc.Process() method processes a request using the Streamdal client, detailing operation specifics and data to be handled.
3. **Error Handling (Again):** Errors from the processing method are checked similarly.

## Streamdal Client Configuration

When initializing the Streamdal client with `streamdal.New()`, you pass a configuration object to customize its behavior. Here's a breakdown of the parameters in that configuration:

| Parameter | Description | Type | Example |
|-|-|-|-|
| **StreamdalURL** | The URL of the Streamdal server instance. | String | `"localhost:8082"` |
| **StreamdalToken** | The authentication token for the Streamdal server. | String | `"streamdal"` |
| **StepTimeout** | Sets the maximum duration for Wasm execution in each step. | Duration | `time.Millisecond * 10` |
| **PipelineTimeout** | Defines the total allowable execution time for the entire [pipeline](/en/guides/pipelines/). | Duration | `time.Millisecond * 100` |
| **DryRun** | A switch to toggle between actual execution and a logging-only mode. If set to true, it won't actually execute but will only log. | Boolean | `false` |
| **ServiceName** | A name that represents the specific service in your infrastructure using this client. | String | `"billing-svc"` |
| **ShutdownCtx** | Context used to manage the lifecycle and potential shutdown of the Streamdal client. | Context | `ctx` |


## Process() Parameters

Let's delve into the specifics of the `Process()` method:

| Attribute | Description | Type | Required? |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Name** | A descriptive name related to the producer or consumer in focus. For instance: `billing-processor`, `db-flusher`, or `doc-handler`. | String | ✅ Yes |
| **Operation** | Specifies the nature of the operation, whether it's a consumer or producer. | Enum | ✅ Yes |
| **Component** | Represents the data source or destination. Examples include `main-kafka`, `slow-db`, or `salesforce-api`. | String | ✅ Yes |
| **Data** | The actual data payload that's being consumed or produced. | Byte array | ✅ Yes |

## Golang SDK Example

Using the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) in your Golang applications is 
straightforward. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/streamdal-go-client"
)

func main() {
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	sc, err := streamdal.New(&streamdal.Config{
		StreamdalURL:     "localhost:8082",
		StreamdalToken:   "streamdal",
		ServiceName:     "billing-svc",
		ShutdownCtx:     ctx,
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	resp, err := sc.Process(ctx, &streamdal.ProcessRequest{
		OperationType: streamdal.OperationTypeConsumer,
		OperationName: "new-order-topic",
		ComponentName: "kafka",
		Data:          []byte(`{"object": {"field": true}}`),
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", resp)
}
```

## Available SDKs

The SDK is currently available in the following languages:

- **[Go](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/go)**
- **[Node](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/node)**
- **[Python](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/python)**

With this guide at your side, integrating Streamdal into your operations 
becomes a piece of cake. Remember, the true magic unfolds when Streamdal's 
capabilities meld seamlessly with your application's data flows. So, jump in, 
integrate, and watch your data operations transform!

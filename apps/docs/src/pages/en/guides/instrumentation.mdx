The [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) should initiliazed in your application
where data consumption or production takes place. The SDK is responsible for
sending data to the Streamdal [server](/en/core-components/server/), which then
processes it and returns a response.

## SDK flow
1. **Initializing Streamdal Client:** The SDK's streamdal.New() method is invoked with a configuration object, initializing a new Streamdal client.
2. **Processing a Request:** The sc.Process() method processes a request using the Streamdal client, detailing operation specifics and data to be handled.
3. **Error Handling (Again):** Errors from the processing method are checked similarly.

## Streamdal Client Configuration

  </div>
</Notification>

When initializing the Streamdal client with `streamdal.New()`, you pass a configuration object to customize its behavior. Here's a breakdown of the parameters in that configuration:

| Parameter | Description | Example | Required? |
|-|-|-|-|
| **StreamdalURL** | The URL of the Streamdal server instance. | `"localhost:8082"` | ✅ |
| **StreamdalToken** | The authentication token for the Streamdal server. | `"streamdal"` | ✅ |
| **ServiceName** | A name that represents the specific service in your infrastructure using this client. | `"billing-svc"` | ✅ |
| **StepTimeout** | Sets the maximum duration for Wasm execution in each step. | `time.Millisecond * 10` | ❌ |
| **PipelineTimeout** | Defines the total allowable execution time for the entire [pipeline](/en/guides/pipelines/). | `time.Millisecond * 100` | ❌ |
| **DryRun** | A switch to toggle between actual execution and a logging-only mode. If set to true, it won't actually execute but will only log. | `false` | ❌ |
| **ShutdownCtx** | Context used to manage the lifecycle and potential shutdown of the Streamdal client. | `context.Background()` | ❌ |

Alternatively, you can also configure many of these settings via environment variables. Refer to the [Go SDK README](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/blob/main/sdks/go/README.md) for more details.

## Authentication

All of the SDKs will require you to provide a "Streamdal (Auth) Token" as one of the parameters in the configuration object.
This token is used to authenticate the SDK in your app with the Streamdal server.

This is the same token as the `STREAMDAL_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable that you set when running the Streamdal server.

## Process() Parameters

Let's delve into the specifics of the `Process()` method:

| Attribute | Description | Type | Required? |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Name** | A descriptive name related to the producer or consumer in focus. For instance: `billing-processor`, `db-flusher`, or `doc-handler`. | String | ✅ Yes |
| **Operation** | Specifies the nature of the operation, whether it's a consumer or producer. | Enum | ✅ Yes |
| **Component** | Represents the data source or destination. Examples include `main-kafka`, `slow-db`, or `salesforce-api`. | String | ✅ Yes |
| **Data** | The actual data payload that's being consumed or produced. | Byte array | ✅ Yes |

## Golang SDK Example

Using the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) in your Golang applications is
straightforward. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/streamdal-go-client"
)

func main() {
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	sc, err := streamdal.New(&streamdal.Config{
		StreamdalURL:     "localhost:8082",
		StreamdalToken:   "streamdal",
		ServiceName:     "billing-svc",
		ShutdownCtx:     ctx,
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	resp, err := sc.Process(ctx, &streamdal.ProcessRequest{
		OperationType: streamdal.OperationTypeConsumer,
		OperationName: "new-order-topic",
		ComponentName: "kafka",
		Data:          []byte(`{"object": {"field": true}}`),
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", resp)
}
```

## Available SDKs

The SDK is currently available in the following languages:

- **[Go](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/go)**
- **[Node](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/node)**
- **[Python](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/python)**

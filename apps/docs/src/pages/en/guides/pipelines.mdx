Between the service and the destination on the Data Graph, you will see your 
producers and consumers (also known as readers or writers; what you assigned as 
an operation type when configuring the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/)). These 
are what you will be attaching pipelines to.

## What are Pipelines?

Pipelines are logical checks and rules data must pass through and clear so it 
can continue to be processed by your applications, and subsequently sent 
"downstream" (i.e. written to a database, or passed to another application or 
service). Pipelines are put together in the form of steps (which we refer 
to interchangeably as rules), and each step has a type which determine the 
kinds of actions to take on data.

<RichImg src={pipelinesInfo} alt="Pipelines informative image" />

You can also edit or create new pipelines by selecting an operation type (a <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producer</a> 
or a <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumer</a>), 
and clicking on Create New Pipeline or Edit Pipeline (circled on the right menu 
above.)

On the high-level overview for [how Streamdal all works together with it's necessary components](/en/getting-started/how-streamdal-works/#how-it-all-works-together), 
pipelines are the "transformation rules" that are sent to the server, which are 
then converted to <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#wasm" class="pkeyword">Wasm</a> modules that are pushed to the SDK.

## Step Types

| Step Types | Usage |
|-|-|
| Detective | Used to analyze a payload |
| Transform | Used to transform or extract data |
| Key/Value | Used to analyze for specific key/values |
| Schema Validation | Allows you to upload and version schemas to validate data against |
| HTTP Request | Used for CRUD operations and multiplexing data via HTTP |

### Detective

Detective is used to analyze a JSON payload. This step type accepts an 
<span class='yhighlight'>optional</span> `path` to specifically search for, and when left empty detective will 
search the entire payload.

#### Detective Types

<div class="table-container">
| Personally Identifiable Information (PII) | Data Validation | String Matching | Data Formats |
|-|-|-|-|
| PII_ANY | IS_EMPTY | STRING_CONTAINS_ANY | TIMESTAMP_RFC3339 |
| PII_CREDIT_CART | HAS_FIELD | STRING_CONTAINS_ALL | TIMESTAMP_UNIX_NANO |
| PII_SSN | IS_TYPE | REGEX | TIMESTAMP_UNIX |
| PII_E-MAIL | STRING_LENGTH_MIN | | BOOLEAN_TRUE |
| PII_PHONE | STRING_LENGTH_MAX | | BOOLEAN_FALSE |
| PII_DRIVER_LICENSE | STRING_LENGTH_RANGE | | UUID |
| PII_PASSPORT_ID | STRING_EQUAL | | IPV4_ADDRESS |
| PII_VIN_NUMBER | NUMERIC_EQUAL_TO | | IPV6_ADDRESS |
| PII_SERIAL_NUMBER | NUMERIC_GREATER_THAN | | MAC_ADDRESS |
| PII_LOGIN | NUMERIC_GREATER_EQUAL | | URL |
| PII_TAXPAYER_ID | NUMERIC_LESS_THAN | | HOSTNAME |
| PII_ADDRESS | NUMERIC_LESS_EQUAL | | |
| PII_SIGNATURE | NUMERIC_RANGE | | |
| PII_GEOLOCATION | NUMERIC_MIN | | |
| PII_EDUCATION | NUMERIC_MAX | | |
| PII_FINANCIAL | SEMVER| | |
| PII_HEALTH | | | | |

  </div>

### Transform

Transform is used to make changes to data.

#### Transform Types

`REPLACE_VALUE`

This transform type will replace the values in the object fields.

Path is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

Value is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

---

`DELETE_FIELD`

This transform type will delete the object fields.

Path is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

---

`OBFUSCATE_VALUE`

This transform type will obfuscate the object fields.

Path is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

---

`MASK_VALUE`

This transform type will mask the the object fields.

Path is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

---

`TRUNCATE_VALUE`

This transform type will truncate the object fields. Truncate length is 
determined by length or percentage

Path is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

Value is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>. 

---

`EXTRACT_VALUE`

This transform type will extract the the object fields.

Path is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

Extract will take only the selected paths, and drop all others. This type also 
allows you to flatten the resulting object.

Example:

```json
{
   "customer": {
      "address": {
         "street": "123 main st",
         "city": "portland"
      },
      "client": {
         "first_name": "John",
         "last_name": "Doe"
      }
   }
}
```

If you extract `customer.client.first_name` and `customer.address.city`, and 
select the flatten option, the resulting JSON will look like:

```json
{
   "city": "portland",
   "first_name": "John"
}
```

### Key/Value

Key value currently operates similarly to the [Detective](#detective) type. You 
can use this type to check against a payload for known keys. In the future, 
this type will support CRUD and DELETE_ALL operations.

Key is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

### Schema Validation

Schema validation is self-explanatory. This type is used to validate schemas. 
Schemas are accepted via pasting from the clipboard. We currently accept JSON 
schemas, but will accept protobuf and other binary schemas in the future.

Schema is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

### HTTP Request
<div style="text-align: center; width: fit-content; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
| Allowed HTTP Methods |
|-|
| GET |
| POST |
| PUT |
| DELETE |
| PATCH |
| HEAD |
| OPTIONS |
</div>
URL is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

Request Body is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

You are also able to pass key/value pairs that will be sent along as HTTP 
request headers.

Headers are <span class='yhighlight'>optional</span> _(but you'll probably want 
to include these in production environments)._

## Pipeline Flow control

When a pipeline executes, the resulting flow will either be `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or 
`ERROR`. Each result will allow all of the same options:

<img src={flowControl} alt="Pipelines informative image" />

Metadata are arbitrary keys and values that will be emitted to the calling code. 
This is also a method to enrich or categorize data for downstream usage.

Between the service and the destination on the Data Graph, you will see your
producers and consumers (also known as readers or writers; what you assigned as
an operation type when configuring the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/)). These
are what you will be attaching pipelines to.

## What are Pipelines?

Pipelines in Streamdal work similarly to pipelines in other products that
utilize step-based workflows. They are logical checks and rules data must
adhere to so it can continue to be processed by your applications, and
subsequently sent "downstream" (i.e. written to a database, or passed to
another application or service).

Pipelines are put together in the form of steps (which we refer to
interchangeably as rules), and each step has a type which determine the kinds
of actions to take on data.

<RichImg src={pipelinesInfo} alt="Pipelines informative image" />

You can also edit or create new pipelines by selecting an operation type (a <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producer</a>
or a <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumer</a>),
and clicking on Create New Pipeline or Edit Pipeline (circled on the right menu
above.)

On the high-level overview for [how Streamdal all works together with it's necessary components](/en/getting-started/how-streamdal-works/#how-it-all-works-together),
pipelines are the "transformation rules" that are sent to the server, which are
then converted to <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#wasm" class="pkeyword">Wasm</a> modules that are pushed to the SDK.

## Step Types

| Step Types | Usage |
|-|-|
| Detective | Used to analyze a payload |
| Transform | Used to transform or extract data |
| Key/Value | Operations against built-in distributed K/V store |
| Schema Validation | Allows you to upload and version schemas to validate data against |
| HTTP Request | Used for CRUD operations and multiplexing data via HTTP |

### Detective

Detective is used for performing various types of data analysis on `JSON`
payloads, including but not limited to:

* PII Detection
* Data Validation
* Key/Value Matching
* Existence Validation
* Data Format Checks

This step type accepts an
<span class='yhighlight'>optional</span> `path` to specifically search for, and when left empty detective will
search the entire payload.

#### Detective Types

<div class="table-container">
| Personally Identifiable Information (PII) | Data Validation | String Matching | Data Formats |
|-|-|-|-|
| PII_ANY | IS_EMPTY | STRING_CONTAINS_ANY | TIMESTAMP_RFC3339 |
| PII_CREDIT_CART | HAS_FIELD | STRING_CONTAINS_ALL | TIMESTAMP_UNIX_NANO |
| PII_SSN | IS_TYPE | REGEX | TIMESTAMP_UNIX |
| PII_E-MAIL | STRING_LENGTH_MIN | | BOOLEAN_TRUE |
| PII_PHONE | STRING_LENGTH_MAX | | BOOLEAN_FALSE |
| PII_DRIVER_LICENSE | STRING_LENGTH_RANGE | | UUID |
| PII_PASSPORT_ID | STRING_EQUAL | | IPV4_ADDRESS |
| PII_VIN_NUMBER | NUMERIC_EQUAL_TO | | IPV6_ADDRESS |
| PII_SERIAL_NUMBER | NUMERIC_GREATER_THAN | | MAC_ADDRESS |
| PII_LOGIN | NUMERIC_GREATER_EQUAL | | URL |
| PII_TAXPAYER_ID | NUMERIC_LESS_THAN | | HOSTNAME |
| PII_ADDRESS | NUMERIC_LESS_EQUAL | | |
| PII_SIGNATURE | NUMERIC_RANGE | | |
| PII_GEOLOCATION | NUMERIC_MIN | | |
| PII_EDUCATION | NUMERIC_MAX | | |
| PII_FINANCIAL | SEMVER| | |
| PII_HEALTH | | | | |
</div>

#### PII_KEYWORD

The `PII_KEYWORD` detective type will attempt to find sensitive info in JSON
payloads by analyzing field names and their relative location in the payload.

By default, this detective type will run in `Performance` mode - this mode
normalizes field names and compares them against a PII keyword hashmap.
The result is that "Performance" is _extremely_ fast and incurs a very small
overhead penalty (`<0.08ms` per PII scan on a 10KB payload).

The downside of "Performance" mode is that it relies on exact key and path-based
lookups. Meaning, that if your payloads have fields like `foo_AWS_SECRET_KEY_bar`,
"Performance" will _not_ pick up on it.

**To address this, you can enable `PII_KEYWORD` to use `Accuracy` mode.**

In this mode, Detective will perform hashmap based lookups, path comparison and
lastly perform a "keyword-in-string" check. While this incurs a higher resource
penalty cost (`~1.5ms` per PII scan on a 10KB payload), it results in _significantly_
more accurate PII detection.
<br/>
<sub>NOTE: If you are concerned about the extra overhead that "Accuracy" mode
    will incur, configure the Streamdal SDK to use `async` mode and enable `sampling`.</sub>

### Transform

Transform is used to make changes to data.

#### Transform Types

`REPLACE_VALUE`

This transform type will replace the values in the object fields.

Path is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

Value is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

---

`DELETE_FIELD`

This transform type will delete the object fields.

Path is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

---

`OBFUSCATE_VALUE`

This transform type will obfuscate the object fields.

Path is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

---

`MASK_VALUE`

This transform type will mask the the object fields.

Path is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

---

`TRUNCATE_VALUE`

This transform type will truncate the object fields. Truncate length is
determined by length or percentage

Path is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

Value is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

---

`EXTRACT_VALUE`

This transform type will extract the the object fields.

Path is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

Extract will take only the selected paths, and drop all others. This type also
allows you to flatten the resulting object.

Example:

```json
{
   "customer": {
      "address": {
         "street": "123 main st",
         "city": "portland"
      },
      "client": {
         "first_name": "John",
         "last_name": "Doe"
      }
   }
}
```

If you extract `customer.client.first_name` and `customer.address.city`, and
select the flatten option, the resulting JSON will look like:

```json
{
   "city": "portland",
   "first_name": "John"
}
```

### Key/Value

All Streamdal clients come pre-built with a "local, distributed key/value store".

"Local, distributed" is a strange term - here is what we mean:

* Every Streamdal client that uses the same Streamdal cluster has a copy of the
full key/value store that is accessible to every other Streamdal client.
* The key/value store is stored entirely in memory.
* Pipeline steps can modify the contents of the key/value store and these changes
will be propagated to all other Streamdal clients.
* Key/value does not incur ANY network hop penalty as it is stored entirely locally,
in memory.

This feature enables users to build complex pipelines that involve looking up
dynamic data, such as "known user id's", to implement idempotency or implementing
a dedupe strategy.

### Schema Validation

Schema validation is self-explanatory. This type is used to validate schemas.
Schemas are accepted via pasting from the clipboard. We currently accept JSON
schemas, but will accept protobuf and other binary schemas in the future.

Schema is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

### HTTP Request
The `HTTP Request` step allows you to perform an outbound HTTP request if a condition is met.

This step allows you to set a "Body Mode" to either `Static` or `Use Previous Step Result`.

When using `Static`, the body will be sent as specified. When using `Use Previous Step Result` -
the SDKs will construct a body that will look something like this:

```json
{
   "detective_result": {
      "matches": [
         {
            "type": "DETECTIVE_TYPE_PII_KEYWORD",
            "path": "email",
            "value": null,
            "pii_type": "Person"
         },
         {
            "type": "DETECTIVE_TYPE_PII_KEYWORD",
            "path": "password",
            "value": null,
            "pii_type": "Credentials"
         },
         {
            "type": "DETECTIVE_TYPE_PII_KEYWORD",
            "path": "birthdate",
            "value": null,
            "pii_type": "Person"
         },
         {
            "type": "DETECTIVE_TYPE_PII_KEYWORD",
            "path": "country",
            "value": null,
            "pii_type": "Address"
         }
      ]
   },
   "audience": {
      "service_name": "signup-service",
      "component_name": "postgresql",
      "operation_type": "OPERATION_TYPE_PRODUCER",
      "operation_name": "verifier"
   }
}
```

_NOTE: As of 05.2024, the only step type that can be used with `Use Previous Step Results` is `Detective`._

<div style="text-align: center; width: fit-content; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
| Allowed HTTP Methods |
|-|
| GET |
| POST |
| PUT |
| DELETE |
| PATCH |
| HEAD |
| OPTIONS |
</div>
URL is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span>.

Request Body is <span class='rhighlight'>required</span> _IF_ `PII_KEYWORD` mode is "Static".

You are also able to pass key/value pairs that will be sent along as HTTP
request headers.

Headers are <span class='yhighlight'>optional</span> _(but you'll probably want
to include these in production environments)._

## Pipeline Flow control

As pipelines execute, the resulting flow is determined via boolean or
`ERROR` results. When configuring pipelines, you can tailor each step to
control the execution of pipelines or optimize the flow of data at every step:

<img src={flowControl} alt="Pipeline Flow Control UI screenshot" />

You can define how each pipeline should proceed by `Don't Abort`,
`Abort Current Pipeline`, `Abort All Pipelines`, adding `Metadata` (which
could be arbitrary keys and values that will be emitted to the calling code;
i.e. to enrich, categorize, or label data for downstream usage), or sending
`Notifications`:

## Example Pipeline

There are many workflows you might normally configure in a traditional data
pipeline. You might want to:

- Ensure no PII or sensitive data is in logs
- Route data
- Clean and reshape data
- Verify data consistency
- Handle errors
- Add automation
- Scale services or data platform

Below is an example of how you would set up a similar workflow as a Streamdal
pipeline in the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/). In this example,
you'll see how you could use pipelines to truncate developer logs:

## 1. Streamdal SDK

The SDK, designed for efficiency, tackles metrics reporting, [pipeline](/en/guides/pipelines/) processing, and validations using **WebAssembly (Wasm)**. This approach assures sub-millisecond overhead, immense scalability, and cross-language compatibility.

### Key Features:

<ul>
<li style="padding: 5px 0px 5px 0px;">**Lightweight Design**: Tailored for efficiency, avoiding unnecessary bulk.</li>
<li style="padding: 5px 0px 5px 0px;">**Real-time Rule Processing**: Employs <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#wasm" class="pkeyword">Wasm</a>, achieving [remarkable overheads](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/blob/main/sdks/go/BENCHMARKS.md).</li>
<li style="padding: 5px 0px 5px 0px;">**Console UI-Defined Rules**: <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">Rules</a> are directly defined via the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) and fetched by the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) for processing.</li>
</ul>

For more details, explore the [Streamdal SDK documentation](/en/core-components/sdk/).

## 2. Streamdal Server

Acting as the pivotal hub in Streamdal's framework, the Server ensures fluent transformation of Console UI-defined rules into live operations. It integrates rules into the **WebAssembly (Wasm)** format, which the SDK impeccably deciphers and executes.

### Core Features:

- **Wasm Integration**: Translates rules for swift, real-time operations.
- **High Availability**: Crafted for uninterrupted and consistent data operations.
- **Multi-Component Communication**: Vital in interfacing between different components for smooth data operations.

For more details, explore the [Streamdal Server documentation](/en/core-components/server/).

## 3. Streamdal Console UI 

The Console UI stands as the orchestrator, steering the intricate nuances of data operations. Rooted in a robust GRPC framework, it offers a communicative bridge with the Console Server, granting users an interactive platform for data rule and pipeline management.

### Dashboard View


- **<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#data-graph" class="pkeyword">Data Graph</a>**: Visual representation of consumers, producers, and topics relationships.
- **Real-time Stats**: Insights into performance [metrics](/en/engineering/metrics/) and data flow rates.
- **[Tail](/en/guides/tail/) View**: Live observation of pipeline data, granting immediate operational feedback.
- **Schema Discovery**: Explore, define, and manage schemas generated from your data events.


### <img src={beta} alt="Beta" style="display: inline" /> Pipeline View

- **[Detective](/en/guides/pipelines/#detective) Rules**: Define guidelines for handling Personal Identifiable Information (PII).
- **Encode & Decode Rules**: Manage data encoding and decoding.
- **[Transformation](/en/guides/pipelines/#transform) Rules**: Set dynamic data transformation parameters.

For more details, explore the [Streamdal Console UI documentation](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

Combining the three components Streamdal's [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/), [Server](/en/core-components/server/), and [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) forms the essence of its <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#observability" class="pkeyword">observability</a> paradigm. 

Each component plays a distinct role, yet their synergy is what makes Streamdal a holistic solution for data operations. Dive into each, mastering their capabilities, and redefine your data's journey.

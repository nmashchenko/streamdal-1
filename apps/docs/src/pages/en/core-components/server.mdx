The Server ensures that rules defined in the Console UI are fluently transformed into real-time operations. Boasting high availability, it doesn't merely store rules. Instead, it transmutes them into **WebAssembly (WASM)**, a format impeccably deciphered and executed by the SDK.

## Core Features

- **Bridge Between UI and Execution**: Seamlessly channels intentions from rule creation into actionable processes.
- **Wasm Integration**: Efficiently transcribes rules into Wasm, optimizing real-time operations for speed and accuracy.
- **High Availability**: Engineered for reliability, ensuring continuous and uninterrupted data operations.

## Server's Role & Functionality

Central to Streamdal's ecosystem, the server receives rules from the Console UI, converting them into Wasm for real-time execution by the SDK. Check out the [server's README](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/apps/server) to grasp its intricate usage.

## Multi-Component Communication

The server is pivotal in liaising between various components, ensuring streamlined communication and data operations.

## Server High Level Architecture

Below is a visual representation of the server architecture:

- Three **Streamdal Servers** in HA, each equipped with an **Envoy Sidecar** port 8083 to handle gRPC web traffic.
- **Redis** operates in a failover mode, comprising one master and three replicas. Streamdal servers communicate with the Redis master for task distribution.
- The **Streamdal Console** illustrates how the Streamdal servers connect and serve gRPC web traffic.
- The **Client App with SDK** is an external entity, representing a typical client application that integrates with the Streamdal servers via API/SDK calls directly over grpc on port 8082. It's important to note that this Client App is not deployed by the Helm chart but is illustrated to demonstrate potential end-user application integration.

The Streamdal Server, integral to Streamdal's narrative, is the linchpin between rule creation and real-time execution. Ensuring data compliance, transformation, and security isn't merely theoretical but is actualized with every operational tick.

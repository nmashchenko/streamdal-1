Designed with efficiency in mind, the SDK handles metrics reporting, [pipeline](/en/guides/pipelines/) processing, and validations using WebAssembly (Wasm). This approach guarantees sub-millisecond overhead, high scalability, and compatibility across various languages.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight Design**: The SDK is crafted to be lean, ensuring efficient runtime without adding bulk.
- **Real-time Rule Processing**: Utilizing WebAssembly (Wasm), the [SDK boasts sub-millisecond overheads](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/blob/main/sdks/go/BENCHMARKS.md) for rule application.
- **Console UI-Defined Rules**: Rules are defined directly through the console UI, and pulled down via the SDK for processing.

## Integrating the SDK into your Application

The SDK is designed to be integrated into your application as a library. Please see our [instrumentation guide](/en/guides/instrumentation/).

## Synchronous Mode

By default, all of the SDKs operate in **_synchronous_** mode.

That is, when you perform a `.Process()` call, the call will block until
`.Process()` completes.

In most cases, this is the desired behavior as this allows you to use the
contents of the `resp` object to potentially update your business logic,
replace data that you're writing, inspect pipeline executions and so on.

Depending on the number of configured pipelines and the complexity of the
steps within a pipeline, the execution overhead added by pipeline execution is
under `1ms`.

## Asynchronous Mode

Some SDKs (such as the Go SDK) can be configured to operate in an `async` mode.

In this mode, calls to `.Process()` will **not** block and instead, the data
provided in `*ProcessRequest` will be handled asynchronously by a pool of
goroutines.

You can enable this mode by setting
[Config.Mode](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/blob/main/sdks/go/go_sdk.go#L240)
to `ModeAsync`. The number of goroutines used for async execution can be
adjusted by setting
[Config.ModeAsyncNumWorkers](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/blob/main/sdks/go/go_sdk.go#L242)
(default: 3).

This mode is most useful if you are intending to use Streamdal to facilitate
discovery and do not need to use the response from `.Process()` to influence
your business logic.

When in `ModeSync`, the `resp` object returned by `.Process()` calls contains
all of the information necessary for determining the status of the execution -
did it complete, did it run into errors, what steps were executed, metadata,
etc. In `ModeAsync`, the only "usable" fields are `Status`, `StatusMessage`
and `SDKMode`. All other fields will _not_ be filled out.

Consider also configuring `Sampling` in the SDK to reduce the number of
Streamdal operations that your service will perform on every payload.

## Sampling

The Go SDK supports sampling. Enabling sampling can prevent performance
bottlenecks by reducing the resource load that your service would incur when
making a `.Process()` call for every request. Sampling is ideal for high-traffic
services where processing every request could be overly taxing.

Some other situations where sampling might make sense:

* You are not modifying data mid-flight
* You are primarily interested in _discovery_
* Your have a latency-sensitive service and cannot incur the penalty of
performing `.Process()` calls for every request.

Sampling can be configured in the Go SDK by setting the
[Config.SamplingEnabled](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/blob/main/sdks/go/go_sdk.go#L229)
bool. You can also adjust the sampling rate and the sampling interval by setting
`Config.SamplingRate` and `Config.SamplingIntervalSeconds`.

When sampling is enabled and a `.Process()` call gets sampled (ie. is a no-op),
the returned `resp` object will have `.Status` set to `EXEC_STATUS_SKIPPED` -
indicating that this particular request was skipped due to the sampling configuration.

## Multi-Language Support

The SDK is currently available in the following languages:

- **[Go](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/go)**
- **[Node](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/node)**
- **[Python](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/python)**
- **[Ruby](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/ruby)**

Designed with efficiency in mind, the SDK handles metrics reporting, [pipeline](/en/guides/pipelines/) processing, and validations using WebAssembly (Wasm). This approach guarantees sub-millisecond overhead, high scalability, and compatibility across various languages.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight Design**: The SDK is crafted to be lean, ensuring efficient runtime without adding bulk.
- **Real-time Rule Processing**: Utilizing WebAssembly (Wasm), the [SDK boasts sub-millisecond overheads](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/blob/main/sdks/go/BENCHMARKS.md) for rule application.
- **Console UI-Defined Rules**: Rules are defined directly through the console UI, and pulled down via the SDK for processing.

## Integrating the SDK into your Application

The SDK is designed to be integrated into your application as a library. Please see our [instrumentation guide](/en/guides/instrumentation/).

## Multi-Language Support

The SDK is currently available in the following languages:

- **[Go](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/go)**
- **[Node](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/node)**
- **[Python](https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal/tree/main/sdks/python)**

There are just two steps to get Streamdal up and running. 

First, you'll need to install the Streamdal 
[Server](/en/core-components/server/) and 
[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/). Then, you'll need to instrument 
your code using one of the Streamdal [SDKs](/en/core-components/sdk/).

## Step 1: Install Streamdal Server and Console

The quickest way to deploy Streamdal is using the provided script via curl. 
This script [installs our docker-compose](/en/guides/deployment#deployments). 

_Note: ensure the Docker daemon is up before running this script._

```bash
curl -s https://sh.streamdal.com | bash
```

Run the `docker ps` command to view the status of the deployment. A successful 
deploy should give a reading similar to this:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                            NAMES
ed6f02a60db1   streamdal/console:v0.1.26   "/tini -- docker-ent…"   1 day ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp                           streamdal-console
75823378255d   docker-envoy                "/usr/local/bin/envo…"   1 day ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:8083->8083/tcp, 10000/tcp                streamdal-envoy
aa59c29d9221   streamdal/server:e074107    "/server --debug"        1 day ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:8081->8081/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8082->8082/tcp   streamdal-server
750468b0c1bc   redis:latest                "docker-entrypoint.s…"   1 day ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp                           streamdal-redis
```

Once everything is up you should be able to access the console at 
http://localhost:8080


## Step 2: Instrument Your Code
With the server and console up and running, it's time to 
[instrument Streamdal](/en/guides/instrumentation) into your code using one of 
our SDKs. Check out the various languages under SDKs here in the docs to find 
the right one for your project, or learn how to add Streamdal to it.

_Want to just kick the tires? Use the demo client:_

```bash
docker run \
  --name billing-service-stripe-register \
  --label app=billing-service-stripe-register \
  streamdal/demo-client:2249e0f \
  -d \
  --message-rate=10,20 \
  --service-name=billing-service \
  --server-address=localhost:8082 \
  --operation-type=2 \
  --operation-name=stripe-register \
  --component-name=stripe \
  --data-source-type=file \
  --data-source-file=/assets/sample-billing-producer.json
```  

## Step 3: Explore the Console

Once an SDK is connected to your server you should be able to see the data 
flowing in the Console UI.

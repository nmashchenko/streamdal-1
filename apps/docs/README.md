## Overview

The Streamdal documentation is broken up into two categories: `Developer Docs` 
and `Resources`.

* _Developer Docs_ contains all of the necessary information for getting started
and using Streamdal.
* _Resources_ contains supplemental information such as support, contributing, and 
    open source information.

### Adding to Docs

We are committed to having informative, useful, easy-to-read, and beautiful 
documentation. We are using [Astro](https://docs.astro.build) for our docs.


To contribute to this repo:

1. **Clone the repo and make your relevant changes in a new branch.**

    You'll probably want to run the Astro dev server to make sure your changes don't look whackadoo or aren't causing build issues. Here is a quick command cheat sheet for getting that up and running:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

2. **Submit a PR.**
    
That's it!

We may modify your additions/subtractions over time for clarity and readability. Feel free to make design requests for anything you submit and we'll be happy to make it happen!

## Release

Any push or merge to main with changes on `/apps/docs` will automatically tag
and release a new console version with `apps/docs/vX.Y.Z`.

<sub>If you'd like to skip running the release action on push/merge to `main`, 
include "norelease" anywhere in the commit message.</sub>
